Testing and debugging an Obsidian plugin on multiple platforms.

When developing a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it is important to make sure it behaves correctly on all of the platform types that it is going to run on. While most plugins that work on desktop will *probably* work OK in other environments, there's no way of knowing for sure without testing first. And it isn't uncommon to discover issues that are unique to mobile or a specific platform.
